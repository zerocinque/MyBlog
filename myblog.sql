(25, 'Reservoir Dogs\r\n', 'Now that we know Quentin Tarantino can make a movie like \"Reservoir Dogs,\" it\'s time for him to move on and make a better one.\r\n\r\nThis film, the first from an obviously talented writer-director, is like an exercise in style. He sets up his characters during a funny scene in a coffee shop, and then puts them through a stickup that goes disastrously wrong. Most of the movie deals with its bloody aftermath, as they assemble in a warehouse and bleed and drool on one another.\r\n\r\nThe movie has one of the best casts you could imagine, led by the legendary old tough guy Lawrence Tierney, who has been in and out of jail both on the screen and in real life. He is incapable of uttering a syllable that sounds inauthentic. Tierney plays Joe Cabot, an experienced criminal who has assembled a team of crooks for a big diamond heist. The key to his plan is that his associates don\'t know one another, and therefore can\'t squeal if they\'re caught. He names them off a color chart: Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Blonde, Mr. Pink, and so on. Mr. Pink doesn\'t like his name. \"You\'re lucky you ain\'t Mr. Yellow,\" Tierney rasps.\r\n\r\nThe opening scene features an endlessly circling camera, as the tough guys light cigarettes and drink coffee in one of those places where the tables are Formica and the waitresses write your order on a green-and-white Guest Check. They argue, joke and b.s. each other through thick clouds of smoke; it\'s like \"The Sportswriters on Parole.\" There\'s a funny discussion of tipping. Then they walk out of the restaurant, and are introduced in the opening credits, as they walk menacingly toward the camera. They have great faces: The glowering Michael Madsen; the apprehensive Tim Roth; Chris Penn, ready for anything; Tierney, with a Mack truck of a mug; Harvey Keitel, whose presence in a crime movie is like an imprimatur.\r\n\r\nThe movie feels like it\'s going to be terrific, but Tarantino\'s script doesn\'t have much curiosity about these guys. He has an idea, and trusts the idea to drive the plot.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that the tough guys, except for Tierney and the deranged Madsen, are mostly bluffers. They are not good at handling themselves in desperate situations.\r\n\r\nWe see the bungled crime in flashbacks. Tarantino has a confident, kinetic way of shooting action - guys running down the street, gun battles, blood and screams. Then the action centers in the warehouse, where Madsen sadistically toys with a character he thinks is a cop, and the movie ends on a couple of notes of horrifying poetic justice.\r\n\r\nOne of the discoveries in the movie is Madsen, who has done a lot of acting over the years (he had a good role in \"The Natural\") but here emerges with the kind of really menacing screen presence only a few actors achieve; he can hold his own with the fearsome Tierney, and reminds me a little of a very mean Robert De Niro.\r\n\r\nTarantino himself is also interesting as an actor; he could play great crazy villains.\r\n\r\nAs for the movie, I liked what I saw, but I wanted more. I know the story behind the movie - Tarantino promoted the project from scratch, on talent and nerve - and I think it\'s quite an achievement for a first-timer. It was made on a low budget. But the part that needs work didn\'t cost money. It\'s the screenplay. Having created the characters and fashioned the outline, Tarantino doesn\'t do much with his characters except to let them talk too much, especially when they should be unconscious from shock and loss of blood.', '#leiene #tarantino', 0, '2017-07-04 12:29:42', '2017-07-13 13:26:25'),
(26, 'kill bill: volume 1', '\"Kill Bill, Volume 1\" shows Quentin Tarantino so effortlessly and brilliantly in command of his technique that he reminds me of a virtuoso violinist racing through \"Flight of the Bumble Bee\" -- or maybe an accordion prodigy setting a speed record for \"Lady of Spain.\" I mean that as a sincere compliment. The movie is not about anything at all except the skill and humor of its making. It\'s kind of brilliant.\r\n\r\nHis story is a distillation of the universe of martial arts movies, elevated to a trancelike mastery of the material. Tarantino is in the Zone. His story engine is revenge. In the opening scene, Bill kills all of the other members of a bridal party, and leaves The Bride (Uma Thurman) for dead. She survives for years in a coma and is awakened by a mosquito\'s buzz. Is QT thinking of Emily Dickinson, who heard a fly buzz when she died? I am reminded of Manny Farber\'s definition of the auteur theory: \"A bunch of guys standing around trying to catch someone shoving art up into the crevices of dreck.\" The Bride is no Emily Dickinson. She reverses the paralysis in her legs by \"focusing.\" Then she vows vengeance on the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and as \"Volume 1\" concludes, she is about half-finished. She has wiped out Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), and in \"Volume 2\" will presumably kill Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen) and of course Bill (David Carradine). If you think I have given away plot details, you think there can be doubt about whether the heroine survives the first half of a two-part action movie, and should seek help.\r\n\r\nThe movie is all storytelling and no story. The motivations have no psychological depth or resonance, but are simply plot markers. The characters consist of their characteristics. Lurking beneath everything, as it did with \"Pulp Fiction,\" is the suggestion of a parallel universe in which all of this makes sense in the same way that a superhero\'s origin story makes sense. There is a sequence here (well, it\'s more like a third of the movie) where The Bride single-handedly wipes out O-Ren and her entire team, including the Crazy 88 Fighters, and we are reminded of Neo fighting the clones of Agent Smith in \"The Matrix Reloaded,\" except the Crazy 88 Fighters are individual human beings, I think. Do they get their name from the Crazy 88 blackjack games on the Web, or from Episode 88 of the action anime \"Tokyo Crazy Paradise,\" or should I seek help? The Bride defeats the 88 superb fighters (plus various bodyguards and specialists) despite her weakened state and recently paralyzed legs because she is a better fighter than all of the others put together. Is that because of the level of her skill, the power of her focus, or the depth of her need for vengeance? Skill, focus and need have nothing to do with it: She wins because she kills everybody without getting killed herself. You can sense Tarantino grinning a little as each fresh victim, filled with foolish bravado, steps forward to be slaughtered. Someone has to win in a fight to the finish, and as far as the martial arts genre is concerned, it might as well be the heroine. (All of the major characters except Bill are women, the men having been emasculated right out of the picture.) \"Kill Bill, Volume 1\" is not the kind of movie that inspires discussion of the acting, but what Thurman, Fox and Liu accomplish here is arguably more difficult than playing the nuanced heroine of a Sundance thumb-sucker. There must be presence, physical grace, strength, personality and the ability to look serious while doing ridiculous things. The tone is set in an opening scene, where The Bride lies near death and a hand rubs at the blood on her cheek, which will not come off because it is clearly congealed makeup. This scene further benefits from being shot in black and white; for QT, all shots in a sense are references to other shots -- not particular shots from other movies, but archetypal shots in our collective moviegoing memories.\r\n\r\nThere\'s B&W in the movie, and slo-mo, and a name that\'s bleeped entirely for effect, and even an extended sequence in anime. The animated sequence, which gets us to Tokyo and supplies the backstory of O-Ren, is sneaky in the way it allows Tarantino to deal with material that might, in live action, seem too real for his stylized universe. It deals with a Mafia kingpin\'s pedophilia. The scene works in animated long shot; in live action closeup, it would get the movie an NC-17.\r\n\r\nBefore she arrives in Tokyo, The Bride stops off to obtain a sword from Hattori Hanzo (\"special guest star\" Sonny Chiba). He has been retired for years, and is done with killing. But she persuades him, and he manufactures a sword that does not inspire his modesty: \"This my finest sword. If in your journey you should encounter God, God will be cut.\" Later the sword must face the skill of Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), O-Ren\'s teenage bodyguard and perhaps a major in medieval studies, since her weapon of choice is the mace and chain. This is in the comic book tradition by which characters are defined by their weapons.\r\n\r\nTo see O-Ren\'s God-slicer and Go-Go\'s mace clashing in a field of dead and dying men is to understand how women have taken over for men in action movies. Strange, since women are not nearly as good at killing as men are. Maybe they\'re cast because the liberal media wants to see them succeed. The movie\'s women warriors reminds me of Ruby Rich\'s defense of Russ Meyer as a feminist filmmaker (his women initiate all the sex and do all the killing).\r\n\r\nThere is a sequence in which O-Ren Ishii takes command of the Japanese Mafia and beheads a guy for criticizing her as half-Chinese, female and American. O-Ren talks Japanese through a translator but when the guy\'s head rolls on the table everyone seems to understand her. Soon comes the deadly battle with The Bride, on a two-level set representing a Japanese restaurant. Tarantino has the wit to pace this battle with exterior shots of snowfall in an exquisite formal garden. Why must the garden be in the movie? Because gardens with snow are iconic Japanese images, and Tarantino is acting as the instrument of his received influences.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, Thurman wears a costume identical to one Bruce Lee wore in his last film. Is this intended as coincidence, homage, impersonation? Not at all. It can be explained by quantum physics: The suit can be in two movies at the same time. And when the Hannah character whistles the theme from \"Twisted Nerve\" (1968), it\'s not meant to suggest she is a Hayley Mills fan but that leakage can occur between parallel universes in the movies. Will \"Volume 2\" reveal that Bud used to be known as Mr. Blonde?', '#killbill #tarantino', 0, '2017-07-04 12:29:42', '2017-07-13 13:26:25'),
(27, 'kill bill: volume 2', 'Quentin Tarantino\'s \"Kill Bill, Volume 2\" is an exuberant celebration of moviemaking, coasting with heedless joy from one audacious chapter to another, working as irony, working as satire, working as drama, working as pure action. I liked it even more than \"Kill Bill, Volume 1\" (2003). It\'s not a sequel but a continuation and completion, filmed at the same time; now that we know the whole story, the first part takes on another dimension. \"Vol. 2\" stand on its own, although it has deeper resonance if you\'ve seen \"Kill Bill,\" just released on video.\r\n\r\nThe movie is a distillation of the countless grind house kung-fu movies Tarantino has absorbed, and which he loves beyond all reason. Web sites have already enumerated his inspirations -- how a sunset came from this, and a sword from that. He isn\'t copying, but transcending; there\'s a kind of urgency in the film, as if he\'s turning up the heat under his memories.\r\n\r\nThe movie opens with a long closeup of The Bride (Uma Thurman) behind the wheel of a car, explaining her mission, which is to kill Bill. There is a lot of explaining in the film; Tarantino writes dialogue with quirky details that suggest the obsessions of his people. That\'s one of the ways he gives his movies a mythical quality; the characters don\'t talk in mundane everyday dialogue, but in a kind of elevated geekspeak that lovingly burnishes the details of their legends, methods, beliefs and arcane lore.\r\n\r\nFlashbacks remind us that the pregnant Bride and her entire wedding party were targeted by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad in a massacre at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel. Bill was responsible -- Bill, who she confronts on the porch of the chapel for a conversation that suggests the depth and weirdness of their association. He\'s played by David Carradine in a performance that somehow, improbably, suggests that Bill and the Bride had a real relationship despite the preposterous details surrounding it. (Bill is deeply offended that she plans to marry a used record store owner and lead a normal life.)\r\n\r\nThe Bride of course improbably survived the massacre, awakened after a long coma, and in the first film set to avenge herself against the Deadly Vipers and Bill. That involved extended action sequences as she battled Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), not to mention O-Ren\'s teenage bodyguard Go-Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama) and the martial arts killer team known as the Crazy 88.\r\n\r\nMuch of her success came because she was able to persuade the legendary swordmaker Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba) to come out of retirement and make her a weapon. He presented it without modesty: \"This my finest sword. If in your journey you should encounter God, God will be cut.\"\r\n\r\nIn \"Volume 2,\" she meets another Asian legend, the warrior master Pai Mei, played by Gordon Liu. Pai Mei, who lives on the top of a high, lonely hill reached by climbing many stairs, was Bill\'s master, and in a flashback, Bill delivers his protege for training. Pai Mei is a harsh and uncompromising teacher, and the Bride (whose real name, by the way, is Beatrix Kiddo) sheds blood during their unrelenting sessions.\r\n\r\nPai Mei, whose hair and beard are long and white and flowing, like a character from the pages of a comic book, is another example of Tarantino\'s method, which is to create lovingly structured episodes that play on their own while contributing to the legend. Like a distillation of all wise, ancient and deadly martial arts masters in countless earlier movies, Pai Mei waits patiently for eons on his hilltop until he is needed for a movie.\r\n\r\nThe training with Pai Mei, we learn, prepared The Bride to begin her career with Bill (\"jetting around the world making vast sums of money and killing for hire\"), and is inserted in this movie at a time and place that makes it function like a classic cliffhanger. In setting up this scene, Tarantino once again pauses for colorful dialogue; The Bride is informed by Bill that Pai Mei hates women, whites and Americans, and much of his legend is described. Such speeches function in Tarantino not as long-winded detours, but as a way of setting up characters and situations with dimensions it would be difficult to establish dramatically.\r\n\r\nIn the action that takes place \"now,\" The Bride has to fight her way past formidable opponents, including Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), the one-eyed master of martial arts, and Budd (Michael Madsen), Bill\'s beer-swilling brother, who works as a bouncer in a strip joint and lives in a mobile home surrounded by desolation. Neither one is a pushover for The Bride -- Elle because of her skills (also learned from Pai Mei), Budd because of his canny instincts.\r\n\r\nThe showdown with Budd involves a sequence where it seems The Bride must surely die after being buried alive. (That she does not is a given, considering the movie is not over and Bill is not dead, but she sure looks doomed.) Tarantino, who began the film in black and white before switching to color, plays with formats here, too; to suggest the claustrophobia of being buried, he shows The Bride inside her wooden casket, and as clods of earth rain down on the lid, he switches from widescreen to the classic 4x3 screen ratio.\r\n\r\nThe fight with Elle Driver is a virtuoso celebration of fight choreography; although we are aware that all is not as it seems in movie action sequences, Thurman and Hannah must have trained long and hard to even seem to do what they do. Their battle takes place inside Budd\'s trailer home, which is pretty much demolished in the process, and provides a contrast to the elegant nightclub setting of the fight with O-Ren Ishii; it ends in a squishy way that would be unsettling in another kind of movie, but here all the action is so ironically heightened that we may cringe and laugh at the same time.\r\n\r\nThese sequences involve their own Tarantinian dialogue of explanation and scene-setting. Budd has an extended monologue in which he offers The Bride the choice of Mace and a flashlight, and the details of his speech allow us to visualize horrors worse than any we could possibly see. Later, Elle Driver produces a black mamba snake, and in a sublime touch, reads from a Web page that describes the snake\'s deadly powers.\r\n\r\nOf the original \"Kill Bill,\" I wrote: \"The movie is all storytelling and no story. The motivations have no psychological depth or resonance, but are simply plot markers. The characters consist of their characteristics.\" True, but one of the achievements of \"Volume 2\" is that the story is filled in, the characters are developed, and they do begin to resonate, especially during the extraordinary final meeting between The Bride and Bill -- which consists not of nonstop action but of more hypnotic dialogue and ends in an event that is like a quiet, deadly punch line.\r\n\r\nPut the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it. I confess I feared that \"Volume 2\" would be like those sequels that lack the intensity of the original.\r\n\r\nBut this is all one film, and now that we see it whole, it\'s greater than its two parts; Tarantino remains the most brilliantly oddball filmmaker of his generation, and this is one of the best films of the year.', '#killbill2 ', 2, '2017-07-04 12:33:27', '2017-07-13 13:35:57'),
(28, 'Django Unchained', 'Quentin Tarantino has found his actor in Christoph Waltz -- someone who can speak Tarantinian fluently and still make it his own. When Waltz uses a self-consciously ostentatious word like \"ascertain\" (as in, \"I was simply trying to ascertain...\" -- the kind of verbiage QT is as likely to put in the mouth of a lowlife crook as a German dentist, or a Francophile plantation slavemaster, for that matter), it sounds right. As someone to whom Tarantino\'s dialog often sounds cliche-ridden and cutesy, it\'s a pleasure to hear Waltz saying the words in character rather than simply as a mouthpiece for the writer-director.\r\n\r\nOh, stop. This isn\'t sounding the way I want it to.\r\n\r\nWhen I first sat down to write about Quentin Tarantino\'s \"Django Unchained\" I kept discarding paragraphs like the one above because they all seemed to turn into backhanded compliments. And while I reckon that more or less reflects my feelings about this movie, a mixture of appreciation and dissatisfaction (and my favorite critical sentence formation is always: \"On the one hand this, but on the other that\"), I didn\'t want to approach \"Django Unchained\" that way. I wanted to start unambiguously with what I see as the highlights and later segue into discussing the reservations I have about the film in its current form.\r\n\r\ndjangocwbeer.jpg\r\n\r\nAnd that brings up a caveat I\'d like to toss in right up-front: Remember when the theatrical version of a movie was pretty much the finished thing? No more. Tarantino has already announced that he plans to release an \"extended cut\" of \"Django Unchained,\" and that he and Harvey Weinstein considered putting out the movie in two parts, like \"Kill Bill,\" but decided against it.', '#django #unchained ', 12, '2017-07-04 12:33:27', '2017-07-13 14:58:36'),
(29, 'The Hateful Eight', 'Quentin Tarantino\'s ultraviolent, ultra-talky sorta-Western \"The Hateful Eight\" is an impressive display of film craft and a profoundly ugly movieâ€”so gleeful in its violence and so nihilistic in its world view that it feels as though the director is daring his detractors to see it as a confirmation of their worst fears about his art. \n\nSet in the post-Civil War era, the movie pits a group of criminals and criminally brutal lawmen against each other in a snowbound Wyoming cabin. Tarantino takes his sweet time assembling his core cast. He spends nearly a half-hour on a stagecoach ride that introduces a mustachioed fugitive tracker, John \"The Hangman\" Ruth (Kurt Russell,  talking like John Wayne); his driver O.B. (James Parks); his prisoner, the treacherous outlaw Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who\'s being escorted to Red Rock for hanging; incoming Red Rock sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), a former outlaw that Ruth can\'t accept as a lawman, and Maj. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), an ex-slave turned anti-Confederate war hero turned bounty hunter whose record of wartime atrocities makes Ruth distrust him and Mannix hate his guts. \n\nWhen they arrive at the cabinâ€”a watering hole known as Minnie\'s Haberdashery that seems as improbably vast on the inside as Snoopy\'s doghouseâ€”they are joined by more characters. There\'s a furtive and rather cryptic Mexican (Demian Bichir) who calls himself Bob, a former Confederate general (Bruce Dern), a smug and effete British hangman (Tim Roth, filling what might otherwise be the Christoph Waltz part), and a smirking gunman named Joe Gage (Michael Madsen, doing the Michael Madsen thing). The joint\'s owner, Minnie, is nowhere to be found, and her husband is missing as well. \n\nThe character tally actually adds up to nine by this point, if you count the driver, but he\'s not really hateful, so maybe you shouldn\'t. And if you\'ve glanced at a poster or trailer or IMDB, you know Tarantino will add more cast members, including Channing Tatum; Zoe Bell; Dana Gourrier of \"True Detective\" and \"Red Band Society,\" and Lee Horsley, who played Archie Goodwin on \"Nero Wolfe.\" But Tarantino\'s never been the sort of director you hold to implicit promises about what you\'re getting when you buy a ticket. \n\nThe movie is filled with playful and curious surprises: not just of the plot twist or character-revelation variety, but what might termed \"formal violations\" that make \"The Hateful Eight\" feel more experimental than classical. This is a director who hires the Mahler of spaghetti Westerns, Ennio Morricone, whose work he\'s sampled many times, to create an original score, then ladles it onto a film that is not a typically sumptuous revenge Western about characters\' relationships to the land they\'re battling to claim, but something more like a crisply photographed stage playâ€”think of Tarantino\'s debut film \"Reservoir Dogs,\" most of which took place in a warehouse, but with Stetsons and dropped g\'s, or a prairie rat cousin of Eugene O\'Neill\'s tailbone-busting four-hour barroom fable \"The Iceman Cometh\" (\"The Iceman Curseth\"?), but with torture; rape; point-blank gunplay; multiple, possibly false identities, and gallons of blood. \n\nBy my stopwatch, four-fifths of \"The Hateful Eight\" takes place indoors, first in the stagecoach traveling to Minnie\'s, then in the cabin and a nearby barn. Tarantino asked his regular cinematographer, Robert Richardson, to shoot in Ultra Panavision 70mm, a format that has barely been used since the \"road show\" epics of the 1960s, and built an overture and an intermission into his already extravagant running time, yet he\'s staged most of the film\'s action away from direct sunlight. This is all fairly perverse, but it\'s these kinds of choices that make Tarantino more special than the filmmakers who dream of being the next Tarantino. \n\nThe problem isn\'t how Tarantino tells his story, but the deficiencies in the story itselfâ€”or maybe we should put \"story\" in quotes, because, more so than any Tarantino film, and this is saying a lot, what\'s onscreen doesn\'t feel like an intricately interconnected series of events, all of which feed into and build upon one another, but rather a succession of set pieces, most of which are tediously repetitive. Talk talk talk talk talk talk kill; talk talk talk talk talk talk kill, and so on, and so on. The N-word is sprinkled throughout; Tarantino loves the slur nearly as much he loves bare feet. But its use in \"The Hateful Eight\" is more problematic than in \"Django,\" where the term had a whiplash sting; even if you suspected Tarantino of trying to get away with something, the film\'s righteous ire (presenting the Confederate South as a little Nazi Germany right here in the good old USA) made you pause before writing him off as an opportunist. \n\nThat\'s not the case here. The in-depth conversations about the Civil War and capitalism and justice vs. frontier justice are superficially interesting, until you suspect they\'re not there to tie the film\'s characters to the American Character, but to set the stage for killings. The context of a nasty, brutish time gives the artist permission to be nasty and brutish.\n\nWhen the violence arrives in \"Hateful Eight,\" it\'s unmoored not just from any morality espoused by the characters (who are hateful, after all!) but also, it seems, from Tarantino\'s own moral compassâ€”if indeed he has one, and after this movie I have serious doubts. From \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Pulp Fiction\" through his recent run of movies, he\'s given us a mix of proudly amoral and morally struggling characters, then shown them working through their hypocrisy and relativism in finely tuned, ping-pong style exchanges (like that final Travolta-Jackson conversation in \"Pulp Fiction\"). In \"Hateful Eight,\" for the first time in Tarantino\'s careerâ€”and in contrast to such brutal, semi-exploitive but ultimately mournful films as \"The Wild Bunch\" and \"U-Turn\"â€”there\'s no detectable moral framework to speak of. We\'re just watching a bunch of scorpions in a bucket getting ready to sting each other, then stinging each otherâ€”sometimes verbally, sometimes with fists or guns or other weapons: tearing flesh, coating hardwood floors with gore and brains.  [Spoilers from here.]\n\nLeigh\'s outlaw, the only woman, gets the worst of it, entering the film with a black eye, taking multiple fists to the face, and spending the final third of the film drenched in blood and missing a tooth. She doesn\'t wipe the blood off; this is presented as proof of her indomitability, but it plays like sheer provocation: Oh, I\'m a misogynist, am I? Tough. Watch me leave the blood on her face, because I can. Like the nonstop barrage of racial slurs, the film\'s relentless and often comical violence against Daisy never feels truly earned. Saying, \"Well, they\'re all outlaws, including her, and that\'s just how women were treated back then\" feels like an awfully thin defense when you hear audiences whooping it up each time Russell punches Leigh in the face, and it dissipates during the final scene, which lingers on Daisy\'s death with near-pornographic fascination. In a movie filled with selfish, deceptive and murderous characters, hers is the only demise that is not just observed, but celebrated.\n\nThe pre-intermission showstopper is Warren\'s account of forcing the general\'s son to march naked through the snow, then orally raping him before killing himâ€”an atrocity that might or might not have actually happened. It\'s so transparently intended as a \"Wow, I can\'t believe the film went there!\" moment that it makes every past Tarantino statement about feeling solidarity with oppressed peoples seem suspect. The bit where Warren describes his prodigious member to the general is oddly childish. Any pretense of political commentary or historical engagement vanishes, and you\'re left with a white filmmaker draping himself in a black leading man\'s mystique, like a kid putting on an Iron Man costume and running around the house telling everyone he can fly. \n\n \"The Hateful Eight\" arrives when it finally seemed as if Tarantino, dissed early in his career as a brilliant but disreputable pastiche artist, was earning a new reputation as a maker of audacious revenge pictures about underdogs lashing out against oppressors: women in \"Death Proof\" (which feels like a more compact but deeper examination of themes from \"Kill Bill\"); Jews in the World War II fantasy \"Inglourious Basterds\"; American slaves in \"Django Unchained.\" Those three seemed at once kidding and serious, in the manner of such Samuel Fuller melodramas as \"The Naked Kiss\" and \"Shock Corridor\" (see them if you haven\'t; they\'re amazing). In \"Death Proof\" and \"Django,\" you could always see what Tarantino was going for even when he didn\'t pull it off. \"Death Proof\" played identification games by putting a male murderer and female avengers in the foreground in each of its halves, making you think about how a storyteller\'s choice of protagonist determines who we identify with, while \"Django\" saw its \"Odyssey\"-like story through radicalized eyes, treating violence against slaves as one of America\'s original sins but violence against slaveowners (and anyone who profited from slavery) as a morally justifiable skeet-shoot, because the latter had forfeited their right to be thought of as human beings. \n\nThe lyrically brutal \"Basterds\" was a revenge movie about revenge movies and viewer identification. It was also the ultimate examination of role-playing in both life and artâ€”a concern that runs through all of Tarantino\'s movies, starting with \"Reservoir Dogs,\" about a gang of robbers tearing themselves apart trying to figure out which of them is secretly a cop. \"Basterds\" aced every set piece, line and shot, giving its orphaned heroine wraithlike revenge against the Nazi war machine, wrapping up with an atrocity that gorily echoed the obscenity of concentration camp tattoos (a swastika carved into flesh with a dagger), and ending with a line that seemed, to this viewer anyway, less a boast than a statement of fact: \"I think this just might be my masterpiece.\" But despite its closing aura of celebration, the movie was disquieting. It absolved the viewer of nothing. It was not a simple entertainment. It was complicated, and every second was deeply felt. \n\n\"Eight,\" in contrast, is half-assed, but carries itself like another masterpiece, swaggering and stubbing its toe and swaggering some more. It has superb photography, music, set design and performances (particularly by Russell, Goggins, Leigh and Jackson), but no fervor, no framework, no justification for its nonstop insults, provocations and atrocities. It has a bully\'s mentality. \n\nOf course, none of my gripes will matter to hardcore fans, who will wave away objections to the film\'s methods and messages with, \"Well, it\'s called \'The Hateful Eight\'â€”of course it would be hateful!\"â€”as if making a lavishly produced but ultimately empty wallow in viciousness were an OK thing to do as long as the filmmaker fessed up. It\'s hard to shake the suspicion that, deep down, he believes in nothing but sensation, and that he\'s spent the last decade or so stridently identifying with oppressed groups so that he can get a gold star for making the kinds of films he\'d be making anyway.\n\nIn the end, \"The Hateful Eight\" is less reminiscent of any single Western than of a certain episode of \"Seinfeld\"â€”the one where Bryan Cranston plays a gentile dentist who makes Jewish jokes but insists it\'s OK because he\'s converted. \"I have a suspicion,\" Seinfeld says, \"that he\'s converted to Judaism just for the jokes.\"', '', 0, '2017-07-13 15:39:07', '2017-07-13 15:39:07'),
(30, 'Inglourious Basterds', 'Quentin Tarantinoâ€™s â€œInglourious Basterdsâ€ is a big, bold, audacious war movie that will annoy some, startle others and demonstrate once again that heâ€™s the real thing, a director of quixotic delights. For starters (and at this late stage after the premiere in May at Cannes, I donâ€™t believe Iâ€™m spoiling anything), he provides World War II with a much-needed alternative ending. For once the basterds get whatâ€™s coming to them.\n\nFrom the title, ripped off from a 1978 B-movie, to the Western sound of the Ennio Morricone opening music to the key location, a movie theater, the film embeds Tarantinoâ€™s love of the movies. The deep, rich colors of 35mm film provide tactile pleasure. A character at the beginning and end, not seen in between, brings the story full circle. The â€œbasterdsâ€ themselves, savage fighters dropped behind Nazi lines, are an unmistakable nod to the Dirty Dozen.\n\nAnd above all, there are three iconic characters, drawn broadly and with love: the Hero, the Nazi and the Girl. These three, played by Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent, are seen with that Tarantino knack of taking a character and making it a Character, definitive, larger than life, approaching satire in its intensity but not â€” quite â€” going that far. Letâ€™s say they feel bigger than most of the people we meet in movies.\n\nThe story begins in Nazi-occupied France, early in the war, when the cruel, droll Nazi Col. Hans Landa (Waltz) arrives at an isolated dairy farm where he believes the farmer (Denis Menochet) is hiding Jews. Heâ€™s right, and a young woman named Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) flees into the woods. It is for this scene, and his performance throughout the movie, that Christoph Waltz deserves an Oscar nomination to go with his best actor award from Cannes. He creates a character unlike any Nazi â€” indeed, anyone at all â€” Iâ€™ve seen in a movie: evil, sardonic, ironic, mannered, absurd.\n\nThe Hero is Brad Pitt, as Lt. Aldo Raine, leader of the Basterds. Tarantino probably wants us to hear â€œAldo Ray,â€ star of countless war films and B pictures. Raine is played by Pitt as a broad caricature of a hard-talking Southern boy who wants each of his men to bring him 100 Nazi scalps. For years, his band improbably survives in France and massacres Nazis, and can turn out in formal eveningwear at a momentâ€™s notice. Pittâ€™s version of Italian is worthy of a Marx brother.\n\nThe Girl is Shosanna, played by Laurent as a curvy siren with red lipstick and, at the filmâ€™s end, a slinky red dress. Tarantino photographs her with the absorption of a fetishist, with closeups of shoes, lips, a facial veil and details of body and dress. You canâ€™t tell me he hasnâ€™t seen the work of the Scottish artist Jack Vettriano, and his noir paintings of the cigarette-smoking ladies in red.\n\nShosanna calculatingly flirts with Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), a Nazi war hero and now movie star; he persuades Joseph Goebbels to hold the premiere of his new war film in her theater. This sets up a plot that includes Tarantino breaking several rules in order to provide documentary footage about how flammable nitrate film prints are.\n\nA Tarantino film resists categorization. â€œInglourious Basterdsâ€ is no more about war than â€œPulp Fictionâ€ is about â€” what the hell is it about? Of course nothing in the movie is possible, except that itâ€™s so bloody entertaining. His actors donâ€™t chew the scenery, but they lick it. Heâ€™s a master at bringing performances as far as they can go toward iconographic exaggeration.\n\nAfter I saw â€œInglourious Basterdsâ€ at Cannes, although I was writing a daily blog, I resisted giving an immediate opinion about it. I knew Tarantino had made a considerable film, but I wanted it to settle, and to see it again. Iâ€™m glad I did. Like a lot of real movies, you relish it more the next time. Immediately after â€œPulp Fictionâ€ played at Cannes, QT asked me what I thought. â€œItâ€™s either the best film of the year or the worst film,â€ I said. I hardly knew what the hell had happened to me. The answer was: the best film. Tarantino films have a way of growing on you. Itâ€™s not enough to see them once.', '', 0, '2017-07-13 15:52:13', '2017-07-13 15:52:13');
